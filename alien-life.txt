Kenneth Nealson is looking awfully sane for a man who’s basically just told me that he has a colony of aliens incubating in his laboratory. We’re huddled in his modest office at the University of Southern California (USC), on the fifth floor of Stauffer Hall. Nealson is wearing a rumpled short-sleeve shirt, a pair of old suede loafers, white socks—your standard relaxed academic attire—and leaning back comfortably in his chair. An encouraging collection of academic awards hangs on one wall. Propped behind him is a well-worn guitar, which he sometimes breaks out to accompany his wife’s singing. And across the hall is the explanation for his quiet confidence: beakers and bottles full of bacteria that are busily breaking the long-accepted rules of biology.

Life, Nealson is explaining, all comes down to energy. From the mightiest blue whale to the most humble microbe, every organism depends on moving and manipulating electrons; it’s the fuel that living matter uses to survive, grow, and reproduce. The bacteria at USC depend on energy, too, but they obtain it in a fundamentally different fashion. They don’t breathe in the sense that you and I do. In the most extreme cases, they don’t consume any conventional food, either. Instead, they power themselves in the most elemental way: by eating and breathing electricity. Nealson gestures at his lab. That’s what they are doing right there, right now. “All the textbooks say it shouldn’t be possible,” he says, “but by golly, those things just keep growing on the electrode, and there’s no other source of energy there.” Growing on the electrode. It sounds incredible. Nealson pivots on his chair to face me and gives a mischievous grin. “It is kind of like science fiction,” he says. To a biologist, finding life that chugs along without a molecular energy source such as carbohydrates is about as unlikely as seeing passengers flying through the air without an airplane.
$$
That discovery comes with some sizable implications. On a practical level, electric bacteria could be harnessed to create biological fuel cells or to clean up human waste. Nealson tells me that one of his former students just got a grant to build a bacteria-powered sewage system. But more to the point, such microbes appear to comprise a vast, largely unexplored realm of life on this planet. There’s a chance they are an important part of the biodiversity on planets beyond ours too. Nealson never utters the word “aliens,” but it hangs heavily over the conversation. His bacteria are unlike anything we’ve ever encountered, and they are forcing us to rethink life as we know it. Like any good alien story, this one begins with an abduction—though one of a decidedly scientific variety. The abductee in this case was not a person but a mineral. Nealson settles in to tell the tale.

In 1982, he was a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography when he heard about strange goings-on in Oneida Lake in upstate New York. Each spring, snowmelt washes manganese out of the surrounding mountains and into the lake. Winds then whip up the waters, allowing the dissolved metal to combine efficiently with oxygen to form solid manganese oxide, which sinks to the lake bed. The trouble was, scientists didn’t find nearly as much as they anticipated. Something was making the manganese oxide vanish, at more than 1,000 times the geologically expected rate, and nobody could figure out what.
“If rates were really that fast, I knew it had to be due to biology,” Nealson says. He suspected bacteria in the lake were getting rid of the manganese oxide almost as quickly as it formed. That theory made perfect sense, but it ran counter to the textbook wisdom: that microbes cannot break down a raw piece of metal any more than you or I can. The mystery kept itching at him. In 1985, Nealson relocated to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, and began research at Oneida Lake to prove his hunch correct.
$$
After a two-year search, Nealson succeeded in identifying the manganese thief: Shewanella, a bacterium that functioned unlike any he had ever known. “As soon as I saw what Shewanella could do, I just went wacky,” Nealson says. “I called all my students into the lab and I said, ‘This is a very, very important organism to understand. Nobody’s going to believe it. It’s going to take us 10 or 15 years to convince the world it’s true.”
For most living, air-breathing creatures, Nealson says, “The glucose that we eat supplies the electrons, the oxygen we breathe receives the electrons, and that electron flow is what runs our bodies.” That’s basic metabolism. The challenge for every organism is finding both sources of electrons and places to discard them in order to complete the circuit. Shewanella consumes electrons from carbohydrates, but it sheds them in an unusual way: “It swims up to the metal oxide and respires it.” Nealson says. “We call this ‘breathing rocks”. Here is where the scientific heresies begin. Shewanella’s outer membrane is full of tiny chemical wires, enabled by specialized proteins, that let it move electricity out of the cell. The wires make direct contact with the manganese oxide, which is how it can deposit electrons and “breathe” a solid substance. Furthermore, Nealson realized that the bacterium doesn’t even care whether the substance on the outside of its membrane is manganese oxide or something else entirely, so long as it will complete the electric circuit.
$$
While Nealson and his team were gathering proof that Shewanella is as extraordinary as it seemed, another microbiologist made a similar discovery. Derek Lovley, then a project chief at the U.S. Geological Survey, found an electron-moving bacterium, Geobacter, living on the bottom of the Potomac River. “Geobacter’s proteins have a completely different evolutionary origin, but they solve the problem the same way,” Nealson says. Finding two unrelated microbes with an affinity for raw electricity provided reassuring evidence that Shewanella wasn’t some one-off weirdo.

Annette Rowe, a postdoc researcher in Nealson’s group, is currently speeding through life’s outer limits in the lab across the hall from where I was talking with Nealson. There are fish tanks, test tubes, wires, incubators, and anaerobic chambers with push-through working gloves that look like old set pieces from CSI. I pass a large tank of slow-stirring liquid, with a family of Shewanella growing inside. (“Yeah, too bad you can’t see them,” Rowe says apologetically.) Motivational photos of Nealson gaze down from tall shelving racks. Sample captions: “I AM WATCHING YOU” and “GET YOUR ASS TO WORK”. The place looks vaguely like an aquarium for microbes, and in fact that’s pretty much what it is. Just as Nealson found Shewanella in Oneida Lake, Rowe and her collaborators have been scouting local marine settings for other electric bacteria, the stranger the better, then cultivating them and trying to figure out what makes them tick.
“We’ve been working in Catalina Harbor. They have a really nice study system out there,” she says. Rowe has the slightly weary look of a graduate student who pulls a lot of late hours, but she lights up when she talks about getting into the field. “Basically, we pull up sediment and sieve it to get rid of invertebrates, and get a nice well-mixed system at the same time. We set up 10-gallon aquariums full of this sediment and bury electrodes in it. And then we look for signs of bacterial colonization”. 
$$
The electrode is the key to attracting the type of bacteria Rowe is looking for: not the kind that dumps electrons onto minerals, but the kind that scavenges electrons from them. Not breathers, but eaters. To those bacteria, a cathode looks like one enormous, electrically charged dinner table. Rowe adjusts the electric potential to mimic compounds the organisms might normally draw their energy from, and they swim right up. As Rowe began sorting through her tanks of sedimentary muck, she was struck by the sheer diversity of bacteria she’d collected. “I’ve isolated a whole slew of electrode-oxidizing bugs,” she says—roughly a thousand strains in total. So far, she’s identified 30 of them, all previously unknown.
$$
One important lesson that has emerged from Rowe’s work is that bacteria have a wide variety of mechanisms for moving electrons around. That finding suggests the ability evolved multiple times. Even more surprising, some of the bacteria, including Shewanella, can swing both ways. “A lot of organisms that can put electrons onto an electrode can also do the opposite and take electrons from one”—though not at the same time—Rowe says. That ability to reverse course surprises me, and Rowe, too. “I’d think it would be really hard on the organisms. You’re basically stealing energy from them. But they do okay.”
Another discovery is even more astonishing. Six of Rowe’s new bacterial strains can live on electrons alone. “It’s a crazy phenomenon,” she says, one that is well beyond anything Nealson had discovered up to now. “I’ve kept some of these bugs for over a month with no addition of carbon,” she says. They must be subsisting solely on electricity from the electrode, because there is nothing else.
